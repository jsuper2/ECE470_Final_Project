The Test Code directory hold example files provided by CoppeliaSim and ECE470 for the simulation software.

vrep_example directory holds the example from the ECE470 lab manual and is mainly for the UR3 robotic arm. All important parts of this example have been ported to update_2

update_2_OLD is the directory with scripts to control the hexapod as well as FK and IK scripts. However these kinematic scripts were written before learning how to use screw motion and exponentials to calculate transformations

update_2 is the most up to date directory containing all the files used in the most recent project update.
